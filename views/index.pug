      //- Use the Pug `each` iterator to loop over the projects in your data file  
      each item in projects
        .cell
          a(href=`/projects/${item.id}`)
            img.thumbnail(src=`${item.image_urls[0]}`, alt=`Thumbnail for ${item.project_name}`)
            h5= item.project_name

        
        
        //- Use the example Pug code below and interpolated template literals as needed to dynamically generate:
          //- The paths in the link's href and img's src attributes
          //- The text 'Thumbnail' interpolated with the project title for the img's alt attribute
          //- The project title for the h5 element's text
